# VESC Express

The is the codebase for the VESC Express, which is a WiFi and Bluetooth-enabled logger and IO-board. At the moment it is tested and runs on the ESP32C3, but it might work on other ESP32-devices too.

## Toolchain

Instructions for how to set up the toolchain can be found here:
[https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/get-started/linux-macos-setup.html](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/get-started/linux-macos-setup.html)

**Note**  
ESP-IDF version 5.2 or later is required for building this project.

### Get Release 5.2.2

The instructions linked above will install the master branch of ESP-IDF. To install the stable release you can navigate to the installation directory and use the following commands:

```bash
git clone -b v5.2.2 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git esp-idf-v5.2.2
cd esp-idf-v5.2.2/
./install.sh esp32c3 esp32 esp32s3
```

At the moment development is done using the stable 5.2.2-release.

## Building

Once the toolchain is set up in the current path, the project can be built with

```bash
idf.py build
```

All targets can be built with

```bash
idf.py build -DBUILDALL=1
```

That will create vesc_express.bin in the build directory under the hardware target name, which can be used with the bootloader in VESC Tool. If the ESP32c3 does not come with firmware preinstalled, the USB-port can be used for flashing firmware using the built-in bootloader. That also requires bootloader.bin and partition-table.bin which also can be found in the build directory. This can be done from VESC Tool or using idf.py.

### Custom Hardware Targets

If you wish to build the project with custom hardware config files you have two options:
1. Add the hardware files to the "**main/hwconf**" directory.
2. Use the HW_NAME build flag
```bash
idf.py build -DHW_NAME="VESC Express T"
```

For option 1. you could for instance add you're two files `hw_my_device.c` and `hw_my_device.h` into "**main/hw_conf**", and then edit the `HW_SOURCE` and `HW_HEADER` macro definitions in "**main/conf_general.h**" to the names of your new files. This method is ideal if you may want to contribute back these hardware configurations to the vesc_express repository!

Option 2. is instead better if you have hardware configuration files in a directory which is outside the vesc_express source tree. You would then, for instance, set the environment variables `HW_SRC=/my/path/to/hw_my_device.c` and `HW_HEADER=/my/path/to/hw_my_device.h` when running `idf.py build`.


**Note:** If you ever change the environment variables, or if when you first start using them, you need to first run `idf.py reconfigure` before building (with the environment variables still set of course!), as the build system unfortunately can't automatically detect this change. Running `idf.py fullclean` has the same effect as this forces cmake to rebuild the build configurations.
